	manufacturer = Insanity Aerospace
	description = With the march to automation resulting in autonomous and semi-autonomous artificial intelligence probe cores in a variety of shapes and capabilities coming from other developers, Insanity Aerospace decided to get on the bandwagon and make their own. With the engineering department feeling that rival attempts lacked ambition of scope and scale, they created the mk3 drone core. The core is capable of fully piloting even the biggest of vessels with ease, and even comes with a revolutionary approach to preventing the unit from going rogue. In event of an emergency, the drone core comes with a crew access hatch and a pair of complimentary wire snips.
