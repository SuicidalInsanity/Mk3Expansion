	description = In continuing the trend of pushing the envelope of orthodoxy in aerospace manufacturing comes the mk3 fuselage T-junction. Given the volume of mk3 parts, we were able to fit in some reaction wheels and even a Monoprop tank or two. Good for bizarre aircraft designs or making stations out of old spaceplane hulls! No refunds.
